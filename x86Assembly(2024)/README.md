This is course content for my X86 MASM Assembly class. 

The file named NonIrvine is plain x86 Assembly using MASM. 
The file named Irvine32, uses the Irvine32 library as a dependency. 

To setup MASM or Irvine32 please refer to the documentation: 
https://www.asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2022/index.htm

For context, I started in the NonIrvine section with the AddTwo.asm program, and ended in the Irvine32 BlackJack.asm program.
